I am a human biologist specializing in the role of **epigenetic processes in reproduction, aging, and health**.

My work utilizes bioinformatics and computational statistics to analyze high-throughput genetic and epigenetic data from large, longitudinal population datasets. My primary research is conducted in the Cebu Metropolitan Area, in the Philippines. 

The overarching aim of my research is to bring the fundamental biological processes underlying evolutionarily-motivated questions to light, informing evolutionary biology, medicine, and public health.
