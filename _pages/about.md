I study the effects of reproduction and stress on health and biological aging. To do so, I use high-dimensional epigenetic data and computational statistics to examine the molecular processes that can tell us about the aging process. 

Much of my work over the past decade has been carried out in the Philippines with the [Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS)](https://cebu.cpc.unc.edu/). More recently, I have applied the same tools to study epigenetic processes in other large, longitudinal population studies, as well as randomized-controlled trails of geroprotective interventions, such as [caloric restriction](https://calerie.duke.edu/).

My research is situated at the intersection of evolutionary biology, medicine, and public health, and has received support from institutions such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). 


Our findings have been featured in popular media outlets, including [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/do-pregnancy-and-childbirth-accelerate-aging-in-women-maybe/2019/10/18/635dbd7c-e516-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/health/restricting-calories-longevity-wellness/index.html), [NBC](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/having-a-baby-can-age-you), and [Time Magazine](https://time.com/6254236/slow-human-aging/).
