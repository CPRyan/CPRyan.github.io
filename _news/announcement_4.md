Have you heard about Epigenetic clocks, but donâ€™t know where to start? In my [new paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.23488), out now in AJHB, I discuss what are they, how are they constructed, and what can they tell us about human health and natural variation in biological aging.

A one-stop-shop for both the theoretical and practical aspects of using epigenetic clocks in Human Biology, Population Health, Epidemiology and aligned fields! Check it out [at the journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.23488) or download here.
