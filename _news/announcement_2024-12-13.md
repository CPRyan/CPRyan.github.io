Our newest paper, led by yours truly, cataloging the vast multi-tissue, multi-omic molecular datasets generated and curated for the CALERIE randomized trial of caloric restriction is now out, in [Nature Aging](10.1038/s43587-024-00775-0)! Consisting of genetic data and three timepoints of DNAm, mRNA, and small RNA generated in blood, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue across trial participants, we hope this data resource has great potential will help to advance the field of translational geroscience!
